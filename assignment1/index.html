<div id="container">
<div id="yellow">
	<h2>Yellow</h2>
	<p>Yellow is the best of the best. It is the color of a brightness, of a sunny day after the winter, of sunflowers and fresh lemons. It brings to mind warmth and happiness and cheerfulness. It is the color of optimism and positivity. Yellow is also the title of a very relaxing Coldplay song. </p>

<div id="green">
	<h2>Green</h2>
	<p>Green is the color of nature. It brings to mind forests full of life, fields full of bounty. It is the color of spring and youth. Green also symbolises fertility and good health, though also envy. Green is also the color associated with life, because mostly earth's vegetation is green. </p>

<div id="blue">
<h2>Blue</h2>
	<p>Ah, blue. Blue is the color of the infinite. The skies above and the seas below, limitless and full of possibilities and wonders, are both blue. It also has a lot of energy, being on of the higher frequency colors. It is also associated with masculinity and boys, against pink for gals.</p>
