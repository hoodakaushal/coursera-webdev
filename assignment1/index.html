	<p>Yellow is the best of the best. It is the color of a brightness, of a sunny day after the winter, of sunflowers and fresh lemons. It brings to mind warmth and happiness and cheerfulness. It is the color of optimism and positivity. Yellow is also the title of a very relaxing Coldplay song. Yellow is mellow.</p>

	<p>Green is the color of nature. It brings to mind forests full of life, fields full of bounty. It is the color of spring and youth. Green also symbolises fertility and good health, though also envy. It's a pretty good color overall.</p>

<div id="blue">
<heading2>Blue</heading2>
<p>Ah, blue. Blue is the color of the infinite. The skies above and the seas below, limitless and full of possibilities and wonders, are both blue. It is also associated with masculinity and boys, the counterpoint to the classic pink, though this association has been getting less popular. </p>
